Mood and stress levels tracker
The project is shows a great level of understanding of nodejs and javascript in general!
The implementation of CRUD operations is done very well with orginised routes,models and controller folders.
Serving the front end from the server side is also a great practice.
Great DRY code!
The idea of the project is also really good. Its useful and its relevant for our times.
Great job!!
